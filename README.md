## Description 
- This website is constructed to display the artists' crafted landscape artwork in a compelling, yet simple and intriguing way. In the digital age, a website can be seen as a diverse storefront to which the traditional brick and mortar can not compare. As technology is granting simple access for companies to reach new clientele in distant places, the purpose for the creation of this website is to broaden the artists' clientele and create a platform to ensure a quicker buying process and enable a fellow artist to contact the client for any queries such as collaborations. 

## UX
- This website is to showcase an artist's work and to build a network amongst fellow artists to collaborate. Client's main object is simplicity, therefore, there have been various elements included; such as navigation bar to navigate the user to the right place and paintings to show the work done by the artist so far. I have also included content for the users to gain information about the artist and footer containing social media links to gain further knowledge about the artist's work. 
### ***Home Page:***
- The home page design is very simple keeping the artist's painting photo to the left of the screen whilst moving the information about the artist to the right of the screen. Navigation bar at the top has been kept the same through out all the pages. Footer at the bootm of the page has been kept the same to keep consistency.
