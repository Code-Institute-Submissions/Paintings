# Description 
- This website is constructed to display the artists' crafted landscape artwork in a compelling, yet simple and intriguing way. In the digital age, a website can be seen as a diverse storefront to which the traditional brick and mortar can not compare. As technology is granting simple access for companies to reach new clientele in distant places, the purpose for the creation of this website is to broaden the artists' clientele and create a platform to ensure a quicker buying process and enable a fellow artist to contact the client for any queries such as collaborations.

Client's main object is simplicity, therefore, there have been various elements included; such as navigation bar to navigate the user to the right place and paintings to show the work done by the artist so far. I have also included content for the users to gain information about the artist and footer containing social media links to gain further knowledge about the artist's work. 
### **Home Page:**

Navigation bar at the top has been kept the same through out all the pages. Footer at the bootm of the page has been kept the same to keep consistency. 
### **Paintings Page:**
- The Paintings page has been kept simple for artist's art only. This page contains 6 Paintings to show the work done by the artist so far. Every painting has been added with popup messeage during mouse hover to show the description of the painting.
