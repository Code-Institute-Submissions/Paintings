# Description 
- This website is constructed to display the artists' crafted landscape artwork in a compelling, yet simple and intriguing way. In the digital age, a website can be seen as a diverse storefront to which the traditional brick and mortar can not compare. As technology is granting simple access for companies to reach new clientele in distant places, the purpose for the creation of this website is to broaden the artists' clientele and create a platform to ensure a quicker buying process and enable a fellow artist to contact the client for any queries such as collaborations. 

# UX
- This website is to showcase an artist's work and to build a network amongst fellow artists to collaborate. Client's main object is simplicity, therefore, there have been various elements included; such as navigation bar to navigate the user to the right place and paintings to show the work done by the artist so far. I have also included content for the users to gain information about the artist and footer containing social media links to gain further knowledge about the artist's work. 
### **Home Page:**
- The home page design is very simple keeping the artist's painting photo to the left of the screen whilst moving the information about the artist to the right of the screen. Navigation bar at the top has been kept the same through out all the pages. Footer at the bootm of the page has been kept the same to keep consistency. 
### **Paintings Page:**
- The Paintings page has been kept simple for artist's art only. This page contains 6 Paintings to show the work done by the artist so far. Every painting has been added with popup messeage during mouse hover to show the description of the painting. Once clicked the view button; photo zooms in to concentrate on itself only and in the footer of the modal purchase query has been added with a "Close" button next it. 
### **Material Page:**
- This page has been added under the painting dropdown as it shows what material has been used for the art. To keep the consistency through out all the pages this page has been kept very simple as well. 
### **Contact Page:**
- The Contact page has been added so that users can intract with the Artist to get more information about the paintings or any other queries. In order to get in touch with the Artist, a form has been added to submit any messages or queries with there contact details.

# Wireframe
- Wireframes were made at the beginning of this project in order to design the website as per artist's request. These wireframes were styled using Balsamiq software.

#  Visual Identity
- Initially, I used LogoMakr to make a simple but descriptive Logo. 
Speaking to the artist herself, I gathered all the information and preferences on how simple and detailed the website needs to be. 
I have kept the colours and content very minimal for this website, so the paintings do not fade away in the process and get as much recognition as possible.
The style has been kept the same throughout the website to maintain consistency and simplicity. Therefore, Header and Footer have been used repeatedly throughout all the pages. 
Home page contains the main image of the artist's work, including information section on the right; maintaining the consistency, the material page has been kept the same with additional equipment images and information containing material used. 
The Paintings page consist of no content other than the images and hover over effect to name the paintings. Modal has been added to paintings so users can view the painting with conteration on that particular painting and purchase queries added which takes the user on to contact page once clicked.
This page has been kept simple so the users would be only using the page for its given purpose. 
The Contact page was designed using bootstrap and was kept very clean with a message at the top of the form for the users.
